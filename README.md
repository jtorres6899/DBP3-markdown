  We are group eight doing The GoodYear Tire and Rubber Company. Goodyear is a very large company across the entire world, not just the United States. With this being said we will not include every single location or department they have we will stay focused on a few within each area. To start we have eight different tables with attributes in each table. Our tables include Projects, Employees, Treasury, Departments, Locations, Projects, Benefits, and Customers. Then of course being a relational database we have relations within these tables.
